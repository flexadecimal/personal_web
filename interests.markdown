## Recreation

I like to run and swim in my free time, and (rarely) will scuba dive.

I cycle more now than running, as it's more convenient.

Baking treats is another hobby of mine, and I like to give treats to my friends and family when I can.

Nature is something I love, and camping is super relaxing for me.

## Video Games

Minecraft is likely my most-played game, with over 1,500 hours.

Factorio, Terraria, and other derivatives are stuff I love.

I also adore the Doom (DOS esp.) series and Castlevania (GBA games!).

Super Smash Brothers is great too.
